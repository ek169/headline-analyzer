# headline-analyzer

This application scrapes political headline data from four major news agencies (NyTimes, Huffington Post, Breitbart, and Fox), 
and then both determines the most frequently used words, and the overall sentiment of the headlines containing those words.
This data is then used to plot data to show bias based off of published research such as, 
"New Media and the Polarization of American Political Discourse" (Matthew A. Baum and Tim Groeling, 2008), "Fair and Balanced?
Quantifying Media Bias Through Crowdsourced Content Analysis (Ceren Budak, Sharad Goel, Justin M. Rao, 2016).
